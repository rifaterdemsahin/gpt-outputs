# GPT Outputs

Welcome to the **GPT Outputs** repository!

## Purpose

I'm planning to create a GitHub repository just to be able to put the HTML outputs with JavaScript animation as well as financial reports, hardware details, and more. This repository serves as a centralized place to host various types of content generated from different projects and experiments.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following folders:

- **reports/**: Contains financial reports and other related documents.
- **animations/**: Contains HTML files with JavaScript animations.
- **basic_html/**: Contains basic HTML files and other static content.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the different folders to see the various outputs. Each folder contains files relevant to its category:

- **reports**: Here you will find financial reports and similar documents in HTML format.
- **animations**: This folder contains HTML files with embedded JavaScript animations.
- **basic_html**: This folder includes basic HTML files that may serve as templates or standalone pages.

## GitHub Pages

This repository is set up with GitHub Pages, making it easy to view the HTML outputs online. You can access the site at:
